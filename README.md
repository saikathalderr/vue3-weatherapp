## Scenario - Weathermap api client

Your app should be a client for the [Open Weather Map API](http://openweathermap.org/API#weather)

## Requested Features

- Display the weather at random geographic coordinates
- Have a form to query and display the weather at a specific city
  - Optional: implement a caching mechanism
- Gracefully handle the case where the location could not be found (display the information to the user)

Have fun!
