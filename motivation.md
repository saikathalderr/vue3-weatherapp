which points I would improve if I had more time to work on the project

 - Implement a graph of hourly temp
 - write 100% test coverage - with small time it's a bit hard ðŸ˜…
 - Improve UI with more information on the widgets.
 - tweak the UI a bit to support small screens (mobile, tabs etc.)


Overall really enjoyed the challenge, I tried my best to come up with good & clean code.

tech used - vue 3 composition API, [pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) for state management, [vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for testing
